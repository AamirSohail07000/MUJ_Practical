Q-Write an SQL query to fetch the second highest salary from the Employee table.


-- Creating Table
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
  empId INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  dept varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  salary INT
);

-- inserting Data into Table 
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0001, 'Clark', 'Sales', 50000);
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0002, 'Dave', 'Accounting',65000);
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0003, 'Ava', 'Sales', 48000);
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (0004, 'Emma', 'IT', 70000);


-- fetching
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;

-- SELECt DISTINCT
The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to retrieve unique values from a column by removing duplicates.
SELECT salary → Retrieves all salary values from the table.
DISTINCT → Removes duplicate salary values and returns only unique ones.
Ex-
If the original salary column contains: 50000, 60000, 50000, 70000, 60000.
DISTINCT removes duplicate values, keeping only one occurrence of each: 50000, 60000, 70000.
The result set contains only unique salary values.

-- Understanding LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1 in SQL
In SQL, the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are used for pagination or retrieving a specific subset of results from a query.
LIMIT 1 → This means fetch only 1 row.
OFFSET 1 → This skips the first row and starts retrieving from the second row.
Here
OFFSET 1 → Skips the first row (empId = 0004, Emma). (order by salary)
LIMIT 1 → Takes only 1 row (empId = 0002, Dave).
