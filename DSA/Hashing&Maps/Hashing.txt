Concept of Hashing and Maps
Hashing is a technique to map data to a location in memory using a hash function.

In C++, we use:

unordered_map → Stores key-value pairs, provides O(1) average lookup.

unordered_set → Stores unique values, provides O(1) average lookup.

These help us avoid O(n²) searches and instead get results in O(n) or better.
