# A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

# RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

# RegEx Module
# Python has a built-in package called re, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.

# Search the string to see if it starts with "The" and ends with "Spain":
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("^The.*Spain$", txt)

if x:
  print("YES! We have a match!")
else:
  print("No match")

# RegEx Functions
# The re module offers a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match:

# Function	Description
# findall	Returns a list containing all matches
# search	Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string
# split	Returns a list where the string has been split at each match
# sub	Replaces one or many matches with a string
