14. Which of the following is true about the while loop in Python?
A) The while loop can only execute a single statement per iteration.
B) The condition for a while loop is checked after executing the loop's code block.
C) The while loop is used to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
  D) A while loop continues to execute as long as the given condition is true.
15. In Python, how can you execute a block of code at least once and then repeat it as long
as a condition is true?
A) Using a do-while loop
B) Using a for loop with an initial execution before the loop
  C) Using a while loop with an initial execution before the loop
D) Python does not support this behavior
