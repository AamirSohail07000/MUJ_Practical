Fill in the Blanks:
File is of _pointer_ data type.
(In C, a file is represented using a FILE * pointer, which is used for file operations.)

auto is the default storage class for a local variable in C.
(By default, local variables in C have the auto storage class, meaning they are automatically allocated and deallocated.)

fgets() is more appropriate for reading a multiword string.
(Unlike scanf(), which stops at whitespace, fgets() reads a full line, making it better for multiword input.)

Memory allocated by malloc() is initialized to _garbage values_.
(The malloc() function allocates uninitialized memory, meaning it contains random (garbage) values from previous memory usage.)

A wild pointer is a pointer which is not initialized to a valid memory address.
(A wild pointer points to an undefined memory location, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes.)

The initgraph() function initializes the graphics system in a graphics program.
(It sets up the graphics mode and loads the necessary drivers for graphical output.)
