Constructor Overloading vs Method Overloading in Java

Constructor Overloading

Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects.

Constructor overloading means defining multiple constructors in the same class with different parameter lists.

Purpose: To allow creating objects in different ways.

Example:

class Student {
    Student() { }                  // No-arg constructor
    Student(String name) { }       // Constructor with 1 parameter
}


Method Overloading

Method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists (number/type/order of parameters).

Purpose: To perform different tasks with the same method name for code readability.

Example:

class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) { return a+b; }
    double add(double a, double b) { return a+b; }
}


Key Differences
Feature	                    Constructor Overloading	                Method Overloading
Purpose	            Initialize objects in different ways	        Perform similar operations with different inputs
Return Type	        No return type (not even void)	                Must have a return type
When Called	        Automatically when object is created	        Explicitly called by the programmer
Example	            Student("Rahul")	                            add(10, 20) or add(10.5, 20.5)

ðŸ‘‰ In short:
Constructor Overloading = Different ways to create objects.
Method Overloading = Different ways to call the same method with different inputs.
